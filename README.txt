yeaaah, so this is my first official solo project. It's 5.17.23, thinking about it now, 
the commit message will have that in it. d'oh.

Anyway, I'm sure I'll come back to actually write something useful here as I figure out what I want to build. 
Maybe something around mental health or something to help the community. boffum maybe.

Just remember why you started this. 

Anwyway,

"the future is better than the old days" from that tiktok about Ronnie. 

Do good
